# Customer Module Test Execution Report

**Date:** 2025-12-29
**Module:** Customer Management
**Test Suite:** `customer-creation.test.js`
**Status:** ⚠️ Partial Success (12/15 Tests Passed - 80%)

## 📊 Executive Summary

The automated Selenium test suite for the Customer Module was executed successfully. The core workflow for creating a new customer is **fully functional**, transitioning through all wizard steps (Customer Details, Account Details, Review) and successfully creating a record. 

However, there are intermittent timing issues with the initial page navigation and one validation message test case that need to be addressed for 100% stability.

| Metric | Count | Percentage |

| **Total Tests** | 15 | 100% |
| **Passed** | 12 | 80% |
| **Failed** | 3 | 20% |
| **Duration** | ~115s | - |

## ✅ API & Functional Successes

The following critical paths were verified as **WORKING**:

1.  **Authentication**:
    *   ✅ Successfully logged in with valid credentials.
2.  **Wizard Navigation**:
    *   ✅ Successfully opened the "Create Customer" wizard.
    *   ✅ Verified "Step 1: Customer Details" is active.
3.  **Data Entry & Validation**:
    *   ✅ Filled "Company Name", "Customer Name", "Company Type".
    *   ✅ Transitioned to "Step 2: Account Details".
    *   ✅ Verified "Lock Badge" logic (Next step locked until current is valid).
    *   ✅ Filled "Phone Number", "Email".
    *   ✅ Filled "Billing Address" (Line 1, City, State, ZIP, Country).
    *   ✅ Verified "Same as Billing" checkbox functionality (auto-fills Customer Address).
4.  **Review Process**:
    *   ✅ Transitioned to "Step 3: Review & Confirm".
    *   ✅ Verified Review Page navigation (Back/Forward).
5.  **Core Transaction**:
    *   ✅ **Final "Create Customer" action succeeded.**
    *   ✅ Success redirect verified.

## ❌ Failures & Analysis

| Failed Test Case | Error Type | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Navigation to Customers Page** | `TimeoutError` | The transition from Login -> Customers Page exceeded the 20s timeout. This is likely a network/performance hiccup locally, as subsequent tests (which rely on being on this page) passed. |
| **Validation Errors Display** | `AssertionError` | `expect(errorMessage).toBeTruthy()` failed (Received: `null`). The test checked for a validation error message immediately after clicking "Save & Next" with empty fields. The message might be appearing too slowly or using a different DOM element than expected. |
| **Duplicate Email Validation** | `TimeoutError` | The test timed out waiting for the "Create Customer" button to re-appear for the second pass. This suggests the clean-up or state reset between the main test and this edge case test might typically take longer than the allocated timeout. |

## 🛠 Recommendations

1.  **Address Flaky Navigation**: Reliability can be improved by adding a localized "retry" mechanism for the initial page load, similar to the one implemented for the "Create" button.
2.  **Validation Message Selector**: Inspect the specific class name for the "Required Field" error text. It might differ slightly from the general error selector.
3.  **Dedicated Cleanup**: Ensure a robust `afterEach` or `beforeEach` hook explicitly resets the application URL to the dashboard to prevent "drift" between tests.
