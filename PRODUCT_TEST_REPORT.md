## ✅ API & Functional Successes

The following critical paths were verified as **WORKING**:

1.  **Authentication & Access**:
    *   ✅ Successfully logged in with valid credentials.
    *   ✅ Navigated to the Products Dashboard.
    *   ✅ Verified "Products" list page loaded (`products-list-loaded.png`).

2.  **Wizard Navigation**:
    *   ✅ Successfully identified and clicked the "Create Product" (or "+ New Product") button.
    *   ✅ Verified transition to the Product Wizard.

3.  **Step 1: General Details**:
    *   ✅ Validated input fields for Product Name, Version, and Description.
    *   ✅ Successfully saved details and navigated to the next step.
    *   ✅ Evidence: `product-wizard-step1.png`.

4.  **Step 2: Configuration (API Type)**:
    *   ✅ Successfully selected "API" from the product type dropdown (verified robust selector logic).
    *   ✅ Dynamic configuration fields (Endpoint URL, Auth Type) appeared and were filled correctly.
    *   ✅ Evidence: `product-wizard-step2.png`.

5.  **Step 3: Review & Finalization**:
    *   ✅ Successfully navigated to the Review step.
    *   ✅ Executed the "Create Product" action.
    *   ✅ **Verified "Success" screen** appeared.
    *   ✅ Validated logic to click "Go to All Products" and redirect back to the list.
    *   ✅ Evidence: `product-creation-success.png`.

## ❌ Failures & Analysis

*   **None.** All test cases passed on the final run.
*   *Note: Initial runs encountered selector issues with "Save & Next" (clicking "Save as Draft" by mistake) and the "Product Type" dropdown. These were resolved by implementing robust XPath selectors targeting text content and labels.*

## 🛠 Future Improvements

1.  **Expand Product Types**: Add test cases for `FlatFile`, `SQLResult`, and `LLMToken` types to ensure the configuration form logic works for all variants.
2.  **Edit & Delete**: Implement end-to-end tests for editing an existing product and deleting it to verify full lifecycle management.
3.  **Validation Testing**: Add negative test cases to verify that required fields (like Product Name or Endpoint URL) block submission when empty.
